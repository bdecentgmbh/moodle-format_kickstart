Kickstart is a new course format which helps teachers and organizations to create better courses. Instead of the empty skeletons teachers usually find (and often students as well), this course format provides up to three course templates to make creating a course a lot easier. Admins can create templates from any course using the backup process and uploading the .mbz to the course format's template management.

Other plugins in this directory enable the course creator to choose from templates; we believe that this is already useful in many cases. However, in many organizations, the course creator is not the person who decides about the courses’s contents and structure. Therefor our plugin provides the option to choose a template not when creating the course, but when opening the already existing course with editing rights."


Features of the plugin:
* Import ready-made course templates
* Add a site-wide instructions for teachers (which can be adjusted on a per course basis), explaining them how to use their new course
* Add a site-wide instructions for students (which can be adjusted on a per course basis), explaining them what to do if the course is still empty
* [PRO] Unlimited course templates
* [PRO] Migrate course content from other courses where the user is teacher
* [PRO] Display a beautiful fallback in the course with the course image, title, description and a gallery of the staff in this course

### Creating templates

As a site admin, go to Site administration / Plugins / Course formats / Kickstart / Manage templates

From there you can create templates and upload .mbz files. These templates will display when a teacher/manager views a
course using the Kickstart format. When a teacher selects a template the .mbz will be imported into the course.
